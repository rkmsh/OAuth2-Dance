## Introduction

This project is a Spring Boot application implementing an OAuth2 authorization flow. It includes an Authorization Server, a Client Application, and a Resource Server. This project shows how to secure APIs and offer controlled access to resources using the OAuth2 protocol.

## Architecture

The project has three main components:

1.  **OAuth2 Authorization Server:**
    *   Authenticates users and issues access tokens.
    *   Manages client registrations and handles user consent.
    *   **(Briefly explain how the server handles user and client data - e.g., in-memory, database, etc.)**

2.  **OAuth2 Client Application:**
    *   A web application (e.g., a simple UI or another Spring Boot application) requests access to protected resources from the Resource Server on behalf of a user.
    *   Uses the OAuth2 authorization code flow with the Authorization Server.
    *   Uses access tokens to access resources on the Resource Server.
    *   **(Briefly describe the purpose of the client application and its technology - e.g., React, another Spring Boot service, etc.)**

3.  **Resource Server:**
    *   Hosts the protected resources (APIs) and validates access tokens presented by the Client.
    *   Uses Spring Security to secure its endpoints.
    *   **(Briefly describe the protected resources offered by the Resource Server and its functionality.)**

## Features

*   **OAuth2 Authorization Server Implementation:** Provides a secure authorization mechanism.
*   **Client Registration and Management:** Supports registering and managing OAuth2 clients.
*   **Secure REST APIs:** Protects API endpoints on the Resource Server using OAuth2 access tokens.
*   **Token Issuance and Validation:** Handles generation and validation of access tokens, potentially using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
*   **(Add more features specific to the project, e.g., Different Grant Types, User Management, etc.)**

## Technologies Used

*   **Spring Boot:** Framework for building stand-alone Spring applications.
*   **Spring Security:** Provides authentication, authorization, and other security features.
*   **Spring Security OAuth2:** Simplifies integrating OAuth2 into Spring applications.
*   **(Add other relevant technologies like databases, build tools, etc.)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met before starting:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher:** {Link: Download Java https://www.java.com/en/download/}.
*   **Maven 3.x:** {Link: Download Maven https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi}.
*   **Git:** {Link: Download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads}.
*   **(List any other specific prerequisites like a database, a local Keycloak instance, etc.)**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Build the projects:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Configuration

*   **Authorization Server Configuration:**
    *   Check `src/main/resources/application.yml` (or `application.properties`) in the Authorization Server project for details on configuring client registrations, users, and security settings.
    *   **(If using JWTs, mention KeyStore generation: {Link: as shown in this example https://github.com/dzinot/spring-boot-2-oauth2-authorization-jwt/blob/master/README.md}.)**

*   **Client Application Configuration:**
    *   Review `src/main/resources/application.yml` (or `application.properties`) in the Client Application project for OAuth2 client details and Authorization Server URI.

*   **Resource Server Configuration:**
    *   Examine `src/main/resources/application.yml` (or `application.properties`) in the Resource Server project to understand how security is configured and how access tokens are validated.

### Running the Applications

1.  **Start the Authorization Server:**
    ```bash
    cd authorization-server-folder
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

2.  **Start the Resource Server:**
    ```bash
    cd resource-server-folder
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

3.  **Start the Client Application:**
    ```bash
    cd client-application-folder
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Access the Client Application:** Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:[Client-Port]` (e.g., `http://localhost:8081`).
2.  **Initiate Login:** The client application will likely redirect to the Authorization Server's login page.
3.  **Authenticate and Authorize:** Enter the credentials of a registered user (e.g., `user` / `password`, {Link: according to this GitHub example https://github.com/dzinot/spring-boot-2-oauth2-authorization-jwt/blob/master/README.md}) and grant the client access to resources.
4.  **Access Protected Resources:** The client application will use the access token from the Authorization Server to access the protected APIs on the Resource Server.
    *   **(Provide examples of API endpoints to access, e.g., `/api/protected-resource`.)**

## Testing

*   **(Describe how to run tests, e.g., unit tests, integration tests, using tools like JUnit or Postman collections: {Link: see this GitHub example https://github.com/hendisantika/spring-boot-security-oauth2-example}.)**
